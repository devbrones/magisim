# Magisim 
---

- Making High-cost software available to consumers and hobbyists. CEM
- Providing a playground to experiment and learn RF engineering as well as optics. 
- Intelligent design:
	- Each tab is a Workspace and can hence be modified using the built in Workspace Editor.
	- Highly customizeable
	- Inherently modular design that encourages users and developers to create third-party extensions. #modularity 
- The open source nature of the software drastically decreases development costs.
- Cross-platform Client and Server, all you need is a Nvidia-model graphics card!
- Decreased computational strain thanks to workload parallelisation. 
- Can support a variety of computational models, such as FEM, MoM and FDTD which is our primary focus.
- Allows more businesses to run simulations that can help analyse product performance and energy efficiency.

## our business model
Magisim Core is free (the server and client software) but extensions are **bought** or licensed to the user for a fee set by the developers, which helps to drive development forward using competitive pricing.
